# ZX Spectrum font
the classic ZX Spectrum 48k rom font pixel-perfect converted to modern formats

### find 4 variations:
- 'strict' folders contains the basic 96 character set with lots of modern glyphs missing, like ñ and such
- 'expanded' folders contains a comprehensive (but non-canon) expanded modern character set that will cover most of your uses, including ñ, `, ´, €, ¿,  et all
- 'inverted' folders contain the exact same fonts but in reverse, emulating the 'selected' style where everything white was black and vice-versa

you'll also find [the .svg files for every character](https://github.com/necronomimicon/zxSpectrum-font/tree/master/vectorGlyphs) and the [bitfontmaker2 sourceCode](https://github.com/necronomimicon/zxSpectrum-font/blob/master/bitFontMaker2Source.txt) used to [generate the font](https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/) 

**BONUS** the 'condensed' folder contains a version that was quite famous back in the day, where characters are just 3 pixels width, allowing 64 characters per line on your 4:3 TV Screen
